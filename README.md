# laravel-scripting

A suite for Laravel developers containing useful time-saving scripts:

- *init.sh*: useful to reload dependencies, cache, routes, etc when performing major changes to the code or when switching between branches.


## Usage

Don't forget to give the scripts the appropriate permissions:
```bash
chmod +x init.sh
```

Also, don't forget to tell Git to omit the scripts (see attached gitignore).

Take the scripts, read them, modify them and use them as you wish.
